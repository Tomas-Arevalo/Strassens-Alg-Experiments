# Strassens-Alg-Experiments
Implementing Strassen's Matrix Multiplication algorithm and optimizing it by finding a Cross-Over point to where we switch to conventional Matrix Multiplication

Also used our implementation of our optimized Strassen's Algorithm to count the number of triangles in randomly large graphs
